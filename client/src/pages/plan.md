### Plan:
1. **Enhance User Feedback:**
   - In both `SignUp.jsx` and `SignIn.jsx`, ensure that success messages are displayed clearly to the user after successful signup or signin.
   - Consider adding additional error handling to provide more specific feedback based on different error scenarios (e.g., network issues, validation errors).

2. **Form Validation:**
   - Implement client-side validation for the input fields in both forms to ensure that users provide valid data before submitting (e.g., checking for empty fields, valid email format).

3. **Loading State:**
   - Ensure that the loading state is managed effectively to prevent multiple submissions while the request is being processed.

4. **Redirect Logic:**
   - After successful signup, redirect users to the signin page with a success message.
   - After successful signin, redirect users to their profile or home page.

5. **OAuth Integration:**
   - Review the `OAuth` component to ensure it is functioning correctly and integrates well with the signup and signin processes.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Test the forms to ensure they work as expected and handle errors gracefully.
